# Automatic trading signals using python 

This Folder holds all the files that were coded during the Algorithmic Trading Strategies for Cryptocurrencies series. 

Each folder is a more extended version of the previous folder (IE Part 2 is built upon Part 1). 

If you're watching the Part 2 video and want to code along, download the code from Part 1 and write the code yourself. 
If you only want the finished code, download the Part 2 folder and you'll have it all there.
