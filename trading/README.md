## Folder Structure
Each folder contains the code written for that part / video and is structured like this:

#### Start Here 
What was created in the previous part / video and is the starting point if you are watching that video and want to follow along.

#### Final Version
Is the finished version of the code at the end of that video. It has similar contents to the `Start Here` folder for the next part.

###### Example
If you're watching the Part 2 video and want to code along, copy the `Part 2/Start Here` folder and write the code yourself. If you just want to play with & run the finished code, enter the `Part 2/Final Version` folder.
