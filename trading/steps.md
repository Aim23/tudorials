## Tutorial Steps:

### Explain:

#### What's a Candlestick 
##### (Showing an image of candlestick)
	- Holds information about the price of a coin/stock over a time interval (1 day, 1 hour or 1 minute) 
	- Open, High, Low and Close Price
	- Red means that Close is lower than Open (over the last interval we're going down)
	- Green means that Close is higher than Open (going up over last interval)

#### What are Moving Averages (MAs)
##### (Show image of chart with MAs)
	- Due to the fluctiations in price, it's hard to identif thends in the shorter term 
	- Moving averages aggregate the price of the coin/stock over a period of time to give us a smoother line
	- Combining moving average with price 

#### Potential strategy
	- Big difference between price and MA (over 4%)
	- MAs cross over + big change in price since last interval (over 4%) = buy or sell signal
